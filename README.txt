Improve page speed by letting slim down the HTML code of menus and category lists to the only CSS classes and attributes your theme needs.

== Description ==

Improve page speed by letting slim down the HTML code of menus and category lists to the only CSS classes and attributes your theme needs.

The plugin is available in English, Spanish (Español) and German (Deutsch).

= Less code, higher page speed =

This plugin deletes the CSS classes you do not need in a navigation menu, page menu and category list. It slims down the HTML code of Wordpress menus and category lists to the only neccessary CSS classes you want for your theme. This results in less HTML code and thus in higher page speed.

If you are very concerned about the loading time of your website and you do not manage to gain seconds or tenths in the loading of the site with 3rd party caching plugins, you may find it interesting to experiment with the plugin Purify WordPress Menus and evaluate its possibilities.

= Demo =
You want to test Purify WordPress Menus before installing on your site? Try it out on your free dummy site and [click here](https://demo.tastewp.com/purify-wp-menues).

= No undesirable visual effects =

The visual appearance of menus and category lists in the frontend remains unchanged in most cases. If you should see an undesirable visual effect to the menus and category lists in your theme, then you can activate the needed CSS classes on the plugin's options page.

= Deactivate it and keep your settings =

If you deactivate the plugin, your settings remains. If you activate the plugin again, your last settings will be used. You do not need to go over all settings again.

= Residue-free deletion =

If you delete the plugin via the WordPress 'Plugin' menu, your settings will be deleted, too. No useless option remains in the WordPress database.

= Default setting: Marks the current menu item only =

The default setting is to output only the CSS classes for the navigation menu items of the current post and the current category.

= Stops displaying CSS classes of parents and ancestors of menu items and category list items =

If activated by yourself, then items which are parents of the current item will not be classified as ancestors additionally. You can set that separately for both menus and category lists.

= Stops displaying CSS classes of outdated page menus =

This plugin filters out the old CSS classes of page menus in navigation menus. Using the WordPress menu configurator the page menu classes are not necessary anymore.

= Stops displaying #menu-{id} =

This plugin deletes the ID attribute of each menu item. In most cases the ID of every menu item is not needed.

= Stops displaying CSS classes of category lists =

This plugin filters out the CSS classes of each item in category lists.

= Uses WordPress standard functions =

This plugin hooks into the WordPress core functions `wp_nav_menu()`, `wp_page_menu()` and `wp_list_categories()`. It changes the results of those functions to the settings you have done.

= Switch on and off every CSS menu item class =

You can:

* select and deselect in detail every CSS menu item class the WordPress core functions `wp_nav_menu()`, `wp_page_menu()` and `wp_list_categories()` generate
* control whether the id attribute of each navigation menu item is printed out or not
* control whether parent items will be additionally classified as ancestors item or not. You can activate to print out both classes on parent items or just parents classes
* control whether navigation menus will be additionally classified with the older page menu classes for compatibility or not.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin take effects on navigation menus, page menus and category lists? =

Yes, it does.

= Does the plugin take effects on the visual appearance of the menus and the category lists? =

Short answer: Normally not and if yes, you can take control of it.

Long answer: The default settings print out only the CSS class for the active menu items of the current post, page or current category. If the theme's CSS uses also the other CSS classes and/or item ID attributes you will notice some undesirable visual effects on menus and category lists. In this case just find out which classes and/or IDs the theme uses and activate them via the plugin's options page until the effects disappear.

= What are the default settings of this plugin? =

After activating the plugin deletes the id attributes an all CSS classes on every menu item except the CSS classes `.current-menu-item` in navigation menus and `.current_page_item` in page menus.

= What happens with my settings if I would deactivate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress? =

Your settings will be still stored in the WordPress database. After you re-activate the plugin, all your settings are back.

= What happens with my settings if I would delete the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress? =

Your settings will be deleted, too. In other words: There would not remain any useless settings of this plugin.

= Would this plugin also deletes the ID attribute of every menu item? =

Yes. It does this way as default. You can activate the output of every menu item's id on the plugin's options page.

= Why is in page menus still the empty attribute `class=""` at every menu item? =

Normally, if you deselect every checkbox for page menus on the plugin's option page, no class attribute should be there in page menus. But the WordPress files do not offer a gentle way to suppress the class attribute if it has no values. The plugin saves time and ressources by not trying an own way. If you would have a trick for deleting the empty class attibute with little effort, then please tell me about it.

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

The translations are handled on WordPress.org. Please be part of the community and help to translate Purify WordPress Menus on [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/purify-wp-menues/). Thank you!
